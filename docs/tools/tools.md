### [babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/)
Babel is a JavaScript compiler
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

* Transform syntax
* Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through @babel/polyfill)
* Source code transformations (codemods)
* And more! (check out these videos for inspiration)

> Jest is a testing framework that will run your tests and it also provides APIs for you, for writing tests. React-testing-library is a library specific to React that allows you to render React components and traverse those React components, or what you've rendered, and then you can make some assertions on that.
